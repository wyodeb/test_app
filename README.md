# README

Thank you for considering my candidacy for this position  
Below is a quick description of the project:

* Ruby version: 3.2.0
* Rails version:  7.0.2
* Sqlite3

Additional  gems
* Nokogori - parsing
* Rubocop - code hygiene
* Rspec - testing

This is a minimalistic version of the app, although
It will not allow object creation without a valid profile source.

For the production version, I would switch to an API-only version of  app.
Validate every aspect of user input; for now, code covers only the minimum amount of validation.
Write full test coverage of the code and embrace the service object pattern in case more conditions appear.
